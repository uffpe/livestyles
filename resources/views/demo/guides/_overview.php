<p>The "Living Style Guide" is a document of all the general UI components used to build the responsive version of the Tabulex website. It uses the same code and structure as the live website, and acts as a common reference to all involved parties (designers, developers, Product Owners, support, clients etc.).  
</p>

<h4>Purpose of this guide:</h4>
<p>The main purpose is to make all in the team understand how the website should look and feel and act as a lexicon of building blocks for the developers to use.</p>
<p>If being used properly and being kept up-to-date it has the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can build consistently, focusing our energy on workflows and logic, not web forms and list items.</li>
<li>We can reuse code instead of reinventing the wheel.</li>
<li>We can see all of our UI components in one place, quickly revealing maintenance issues and test they work responsively and as intended accross different platforms and devices.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Who should use this guide:</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Developers: </b>Should use the guide as a lexicon of possible building blocks. The guide contains code examples and explanations of how to use the different components.</li>
<li><b>Designers: </b>...</li>
<li><b>Management: </b> ...</li>
<li><b>Support: </b> ...</li>
